## About

In today's attention economy and society is it true that people also prefer shorter films? This consideration guided us in the realization of this project and allowed us to determine the following research question: do shorter films generally receive better ratings?

We have therefore used the datasets provided by IMDb to answer the research question through an interactive visualization.
